My part of the code.
But even though It's older and messier code I am still proud of what 
already could do in the first year.
Also the "Main" file is made with the 2 other developers.


The initial part that I made was a small program where you could input name and race in a fantasy style way.
Later this evolved and I added a combat system and a friend of mine started helping with the project.
He added a travel system and a quest to the game.
Then we wanted sound and another friend helped with the game and we then had sound.
I alse made a dungeon with traps and such, your health would stay the same everywhere until you healed.

-In short what I did.

Identity setup.

Combat system.

Dungeon.

Enemies.
